# blockchain-voting-system
A secure and transparent blockchain-based voting system that uses decentralized technology and smart contracts to ensure tamper-proof, verifiable, and trustworthy digital voting. This project focuses on security, transparency, and real-world blockchain application design.
# 🗳 Blockchain-Based Voting System

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a secure and decentralized voting system built
using blockchain technology. It eliminates vote tampering, ensures voter
privacy, and provides transparent and verifiable election results.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Traditional voting systems can suffer from fraud, manipulation, and lack
of transparency. This project aims to solve these issues by leveraging
blockchain's immutability and decentralization.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Build a secure digital voting system
- Ensure transparency and trust using blockchain
- Prevent vote tampering and duplication
- Understand real-world blockchain architecture

## 🛠 Tech Stack
Blockchain:
- Ethereum
- Smart Contracts (Solidity)

Backend:
- Node.js
- Web3.js

Frontend:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Tools:
- MetaMask
- Ganache (local blockchain)
- Truffle (conceptual)

## ✨ Features

Included:
- Voter registration
- Secure vote casting
- Immutable vote storage
- Transparent result counting
- Decentralized architecture

Not Included:
- National-scale deployment
- Identity verification with Aadhaar
- Production blockchain network

## ⚙ How It Works
1. Voter registers using a blockchain address
2. Smart contract verifies eligibility
3. Vote is cast and stored on blockchain
4. Votes cannot be altered once recorded
5. Results are transparently counted
